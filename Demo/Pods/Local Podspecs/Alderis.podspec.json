  "description": "Alderis is a fresh new color picker, with a gentle, fun, and dead simple user\ninterface. It aims to incorporate the usual elements of a color picker, in a way\nthat users will find easy and fun to use.\n\nThe user can start by selecting a color they like on the initial color palette\ntab, and either accept it, or refine it using the color wheel and adjustment\nsliders found on the two other tabs.",
